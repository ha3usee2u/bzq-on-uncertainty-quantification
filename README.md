# bzq-on-uncertainty-quantification
## üìò Overview

This repository contains a collection of `.ipynb` notebooks documenting raw experiments on uncertainty quantification. Please note that some notebooks include **hardcoded file paths**, which means they may **not run correctly on other machines** without modification.

These notebooks are intended primarily for:
- Recording experimental setups and results
- Sharing methodological insights and implementation details

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:**  
To reproduce the experiments, please ensure:
- Required datasets and model files are placed in the expected directories
- Your Python environment matches the dependencies used in the notebooks

These files are not guaranteed to be portable or fully reproducible across systems. They serve as research logs rather than polished, production-ready code.
